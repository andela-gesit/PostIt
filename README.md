# PostIt

### Introduction 
PostIt is a simple application that allows friends and colleagues to create groups for communication. 

### Technologies used
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) This is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is used for installing and managing the dependencies.
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) The front end is developed using the ReactJS library
* [Redux](https://redux.org) State is contained on the client side using Redux
* [socket.io](https://socket.io) This is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. It was used for real-time communication among members of groups
* [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com) This is an e-mail sending Nodejs module created by Andris Reinman. It is used in parts of the app that involve sending emails (password reset, group notifications);

### Documentation
A comprehensive swagger documentation is available [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/victor4l/post-it_application/1.0.0)

### Installation Guide
* Clone the repository [here](www.github.com/andela-gesit/postit)
* Download and install [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* If `pgadmin` was not automatically installed with the `Postgresql`installation, install it [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
* On `pgadmin`, create a database for the app. Modify the local copy of the [config](https://github.com/andela-gesit/PostIt/blob/develop/server/config/config.json) file to contain your database configurations

### Usage
##### On local computer 
* Run `npm start` to run the app.
* Connect to the app on `Postman`, using port `8002`
##### On Heroku
* A sample of the API is hosted [here](https://postit-api-victor.herokuapp.com/api). However, you could create your own copy on `Heroku`, to connect your own team members. A guide to hosting an app on 
`Heroku` is available [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)
* `Routes`: Use the same routes as specified in the instructions for Postman above.

### Testing
To test the application codebase
* Run `npm test`, to view test output, and `gulp coverage` to view the code coverage

### Limitations
This app, though awesome still has some shortcomings.
* Real time notifications are not set up.
* It is not an effective app for real time messaging. The socket.io implementation hasn't factor in a lot of the edge cases that come into play in realtime messaging applications.
* A user's profile cannot be updated. Passwords can be reset though.
* Images cannot be uploaded onto the application
